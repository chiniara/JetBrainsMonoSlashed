# JetBrains Mono Slashed

The [JetBrains Mono](https://jetbrains.com/mono) font, with slashed zero made
the default.

**JetBrains Mono** provides slashed zero as an optional OpenType feature, but
few programs know how to discover and enable OpenType features.  **JetBrains
Mono Slashed** makes the feature enabled by default, so that all programs can
display slashed zero.

JetBrains Mono is developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono).
